## Hi there 😁

I am [Nimesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nimeshsiri/), A tech professional and part-time student based in Sri Lanka 🇱🇰

I test systems and ensure the quality is met in the early stages of development. QA is not just about the happy paths; it's about ensuring we own quality from the beginning. 👌

I am an undergraduate currently. pursuing a Higher Diploma in computing and software engineering.

If an idea pops into my head, I build it. I love cool mini projects on my own that challenge me to improve. 

### My Stack

+ JavaScript / TypeScript

+ PostgreSQL

### Fun Facts about me 
I got into tech and QA mostly through self-learning and practice 😎. I am currently mastering JavaScript on my own and working on my first repo for [Playwright Automation](https://github.com/nimeshsiridemuni/playwright-automation-framework-using-js)
I am also learning OOP with JavaScript and Python
  
+ Even though my main JD is QA, I am also actively pursuing knowledge in Backend Development and Business Analytics, and a bit of Data Science. 🤓
