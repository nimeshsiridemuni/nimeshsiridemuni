## Hi there 😁

I am [Nimesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nimeshsiri/), A tech professional and part-time student based in Sri Lanka 🇱🇰

I test systems and ensure the quality is met in the early stages of development. QA is not about just the happy paths; it's making sure we own quality from the beginning! 👌

If an idea pops into my head, I build it. I love cool mini projects on my own that challenge me to improve. 

### My Stack

+ JavaScript 

+ PostGreSQL

### Fun Facts about me 
+ I got into tech and QA mostly with self learning and practice 😎. I am currently mastering JavaScript on my own and working on my first repo for [Playwright Automation](https://github.com/nimeshsiridemuni/playwright-automation-framework-using-js)
  
+ Even though my main JD is QA, I am also actively pursuing knowledge in Software Development and Business Analytics, and a bit of Data Science. 🤓
